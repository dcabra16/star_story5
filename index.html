                <h2 class="section-title">Situation</h2>
            <p>Throughout the semester, I began to understand how project management tools and principles could help me grow both academically and personally. 
                As I learned more about planning, tracking progress, and evaluating results,
                I started thinking differently about how I approach my goals and challenges.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Task-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Task</h2>
        <p>I wanted to use the skills and tools from class to guide myself toward a more organized and intentional future. 
            My goal was to create habits that would support long-term improvement, not just help me finish class assignments.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Action-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Action</h2>
            <p>I began applying project management methods to my daily life. One example is using SWOT analysis regularly to identify my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This helped me recognize patterns in how I work, where I struggle, and where I can grow. 
                I paired that with planning tools like milestone check-ins and lessons-learned reflections, which helped me stay aware of what was working and what needed to change. 
                Over time, I used these insights to adjust my study habits, prioritize tasks, and stay focused on my long-term goals.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Result-->
            <div class="info-box">
                <h2 class="section-title">Result</h2>
            <p>Using SWOT analysis along with project management techniques helped me make real improvements in how I work and think. I became more structured, more self-aware, and better at anticipating challenges before they slowed me down. These habits are now part of how I plan for the future, enabling me to move confidently toward the goals and changes I want to achieve.</p>
